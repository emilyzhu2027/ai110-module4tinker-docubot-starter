# DocuBot

DocuBot is a small documentation assistant that helps answer developer questions about a codebase.  
It can operate in three different modes:

1. **Naive LLM mode**  
   Sends the entire documentation corpus to a Gemini model and asks it to answer the question.

2. **Retrieval only mode**  
   Uses a simple indexing and scoring system to retrieve relevant snippets without calling an LLM.

3. **RAG mode (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**  
   Retrieves relevant snippets, then asks Gemini to answer using only those snippets.

The docs folder contains realistic developer documents (API reference, authentication notes, database notes), but these files are **just text**. They support retrieval experiments and do not require students to set up any backend systems.

## TF Task
* The core concept students needed to understand
    * Understanding the differences between three different AI reasoning techniques and how retrieval can impact/augment AI performance
* Where students are most likely to struggle
    * Identifying the best retrieval method implementation that balances between implementability and effectiveness
* Where AI was helpful vs misleading
    * AI was helpful in brainstorming various retrieval methods and understanding how retrieval can contribute to an AI system's understanding of the problem
    * AI was misleading when implementing the guardrail portion of the project, because it struggled to understand what guardrails meant in this situation and where best to place these guardrails as the concept is somewhat up to interpretation.
* One way they would guide a student without giving the answer
    * Suggest thinking through with teammates or with AI how to chunk the documents into manageable and interpretable text chunks for the retrieval, so that it is both user-readable and useful context for the LLM.

## Setup

### 1. Install Python dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### 2. Configure environment variables

Copy the example file:

    cp .env.example .env

Then edit `.env` to include your Gemini API key:

    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

If you do not set a Gemini key, you can still run retrieval only mode.

---

## Running DocuBot

Start the program:

    python main.py

Choose a mode:

- **1**: Naive LLM (Gemini reads the full docs)  
- **2**: Retrieval only (no LLM)  
- **3**: RAG (retrieval + Gemini)

You can use built in sample queries or type your own.

---

## Running Retrieval Evaluation (optional)

    python evaluation.py

This prints simple retrieval hit rates for sample queries.

---

## Modifying the Project

You will primarily work in:

- `docubot.py`  
  Implement or improve the retrieval index, scoring, and snippet selection.

- `llm_client.py`  
  Adjust the prompts and behavior of LLM responses.

- `dataset.py`  
  Add or change sample queries for testing.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- A Gemini API key for LLM features (only needed for modes 1 and 3)
- No database, no server setup, no external services besides LLM calls
